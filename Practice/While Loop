/*
While Loop :-  The while loop in Java is used when you want to repeat a block of code
as long as a condition is true. The condition is checked before the code runs.

Syntax :-
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
 .condition: a boolean expression (true or false).
 .If true, the code block executes.
 .If false, the loop stops.

Flowchart :-
1) Check condition
2) If true → execute code → go back to step 1
3) If false → exit loop
 */


// The program to print numbers from 1 to 5 is 

public class While_Loop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 1;
        while (i<=5) {
            System.out.println(i);
            i++;
        }
    }
}



/*
// The program to print the sum of first 10 numbers are

public class While_Loop {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
    int i = 0 ;
    int sum = 0;
    while (i<=0) {
        sum += i ;
        i++;
    }
    System.out.println("Sum is  " + sum );
  }
}

Output :-
Sum is 55
