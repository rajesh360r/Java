/*
Do-While Loop :- The do-while loop in java is used when we want to execute the
block of code at least once, even if the condition is false, because
the condition is checked after the loop body.

Syntax :-
do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);

Note :- Notice the semicolon (;) after while(condition).

Flowchart :-
1) Execute code block
2) Check condition
3) If true → repeat
4) If false → exit loop
 */


// The program to print numbers from 1 to 5 is


public class DoWhile_Loop {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        int i = 1;
        do {
            System.out.println(i);
            i++;
        } while (i <= 5);
    }
}



/*
Do-While loop runs and gives one output even condition is false

Code :-
public class Do_While {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 10;
        do {
            System.out.println("This runs even though i > 5");
        } while (i < 5); // condition is false
    }
}
